Oder nie mehr etwas vergessen: Ihr sollt auf dem Nachhauseweg noch Milch mitbringen? Lasst euch von der Google Suche-App im richtigen Moment daran erinnern. Tippt einfach auf das Mikrofon-Symbol und sagt zum Beispiel ‚ÄúErinnere mich daran Milch zu kaufen bei Edeka in der Osterstra√üe‚Äù - und schwupps, automatisch werdet ihr daran erinnert, wenn ihr bei Edeka vorbei lauft. #googletipps
